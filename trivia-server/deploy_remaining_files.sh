The following files need to be created from the AI artifacts:

1. routes/adminRoutes.js - Use content from artifact "admin-routes-fixed"
2. routes/exportRoutes.js - Use content from artifact "export-routes"
3. services/exportService.js - Use content from artifact "export-service"
4. services/themeService.js - Use content from artifact "theme-service"
5. services/questionService.js - Use content from artifact "question-service"
6. services/prizeService.js - Use content from artifact "prize-service"
7. services/brandingService.js - Use content from artifact "branding-service"
8. /var/www/html/admin/monitoring/dashboard.html - Use content from artifact "dashboard-html-updated"
9. /var/www/html/admin/login.html - Use content from artifact "admin-login-html"

These files are too large to include in a single bash script.
Please copy each artifact content to its respective file location.
